# Live Project
 Prosper IT Consulting gave my team and I the task to create a new website design for a theatre company called Theatre Vertigo. My team consisted of two designers, Hunter Lock and I, and our technical project manager, Lace Woodbury. Obstacles we faced included limited information from the client and time restriction of two weeks to complete our project. 
After coming up with a style guide, which included a color palette, font styles and sizes, my team and I got started on creating wireframes. Using Photoshop, I created wireframes for what the layout of our website should look like. From these wireframes, my team and I were able to create mockups of our designs which included a navigation bar, a footer, a drop-down menu and buttons, as well as the overall look of the website. 
From these mockups, we then went into the prototyping phase of our project. Using Adobe XD, I created anchor links to connect our pages together as well as created hover animation effects for our buttons, navbar and drop-down menu. 
Through great communication and hard work, my team was able to create a beautiful, responsive designed website for Theatre Vertigo.
